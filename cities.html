    <h1>Karachi</h1>
    <img src="./images/karachi.jpeg" alt="karachi">
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> Karachi is the capital of the Pakistani province of Sindh.
        Situated on the Arabian Sea, Karachi serves as a transport hub, and is home to Pakistan's two largest seaports,
        the Port of Karachi and Port Bin Qasim, as well as the busiest airport in Pakistan. Though the Karachi region
        has been inhabited for millennia, the city was founded as the fortified village of Kolachi in 1729.

        Karachi is one of the world's fastest growing cities, and has communities representing almost every ethnic group
        in Pakistan.

        Karachi is built on a coastal plains with scattered rocky outcroppings, hills and coastal marshlands. Coastal
        mangrove forests grow in the brackish waters around the Karachi Harbour, and farther southeast towards the
        expansive Indus River Delta. West of Karachi city is the Cape Monze, locally known as Ras Muari, which is an
        area characterised by sea cliffs, rocky sandstone promontories and undeveloped beaches.

        Within the city of Karachi are two small ranges: the Khasa Hills and Mulri Hills, which lie in the northwest and
        act as a barrier between North Nazimabad Town and Orangi Town. Karachi's hills are barren and are part of the
        larger Kirthar Range, and have a maximum elevation of 528 metres (1,732 feet)</p>

    <h1>Lahore</h1>
    <img src="./images/lahore.jpeg" alt="karachi">
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">According to oral traditions, Lahore was named after Lava, son of the Hindu god Rama,
        who supposedly founded the city. Lahore Fort has a vacant temple dedicated in honour of Lava. Likewise, the Ravi
        River that flows through northern Lahore was said to be named in honour of the Hindu goddess Durga.[1]

        Ptolemy, the celebrated astronomer and geographer, mentions in his Geographia a city called Labokla[2] situated
        on the route between the Indus river in a region described as extending along the rivers Bidastes or Vitasta
        (Jhelum), Sandabal or Chandra Bhaga (Chenab), and Adris or Iravati (Ravi).

        The oldest authentic document about Lahore was written anonymously in 982 and is called Hudud-i-Alam.[3] It was
        translated into English by Vladimir Fedorovich Minorsky and published in Lahore in 1927. In this document,
        Lahore is referred to as a small shahr (city) with "impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards." It
        refers to "two major markets around which dwellings exist," and it also mentions "the mud walls that enclose
        these two dwellings to make it one." The original document is currently held in the British Museum.[</p>

    <h1>Islamabad</h1>
    <img src="./images/islamabad.jpeg" alt="Islamabad">
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Islamabad, city, capital of Pakistan, on the Potwar Plateau, 9 miles (14 km) northeast of Rawalpindi, the former
        interim capital.

        Islamabad, Pakistan
        Islamabad, Pakistan
        The city’s site was chosen by a commission in 1959 after Karachi was found unsuitable as the capital.
        Construction began in 1961 with an effort to blend traditional Islamic architecture with modern patterns and
        requirements. Such world-renowned names in town planning and architecture as Konstantínos Doxiádes, Edward
        Durell Stone, and Gio Ponti have been associated with the city’s development. It is a compact city (area 25
        square miles [65 square km]), lying at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 feet (450 to 600 metres). The
        second phase of construction ended with completion of the Secretariat, Pakistan House, President’s House,
        National Assembly Building, Grand National Mosque, and housing for government staff. The University of Islamabad
        was established in 1965 and the People’s Open University (later renamed the Allama Iqbal Open University) in
        1974. The war with India in 1971 slowed construction temporarily.</p>
