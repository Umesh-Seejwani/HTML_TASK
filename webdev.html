        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web
                browsers to render pages on the world wide web. HyperText allows a user to click a link and be
                redirected to a new page referenced by that link.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Open a text editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, and begin
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Learning HTML can provide tremendous value to people working in tech, as well
                as to those who are running their own business or managing a website.

        </ul>


        <h5 style="font-size: 2rem;"> &nbsp;2. CSS:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language
                for laying out and
                structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these
                “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics
                walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red?</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 style="font-size: 2rem;"> &nbsp;3. JAVASCRIPT:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
                programming language with first-class functions.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and
                interactive web content like applications and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used
                programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5 style="font-size: 2rem;"> &nbsp;4. REACT AND NODE.JS:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">React JS is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) for
                single-page applications. React manages the view layer and is used for the development of both web and
                mobile applications.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">React can be used to build web, mobile, and desktop applications, making it a
                versatile framework for cross-platform development. React Native, a framework based on React, is
                specifically designed for mobile app development, while React Desktop allows you to create desktop
                applications using web technologies.</li>
                <br>
          
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Developers use Node. js to create server-side web applications, and it is
                perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. Now that we
                know what is Node, let's look at why it is so prevalent in web development.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Node is a JavaScript runtime. It's not a language or a framework. It's simply
                an environment that allows you to write JavaScript that interacts with different parts of the outside
                world other than the browser.</li>
        </ul>
